# Telemetry Weather Logging

## **NOTICE: REPOSITORIES INTEGRATED INTO SINGLE REPOSITORY**

This repository along with other related repositories have been integrated into [**Vehicle Telemetry System**, a system for collecting and processing motor vehicle data using included sensor modules.](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/vehicle-telemetry-system).

## **Under Construction**

The Telemetry Weather Logger captures weather/environment data using a [WeatherFlow Tempest](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/) weather station.

## Motivation

Integrate weather data with vehicle engine and location data for better, more accurate analytics.

At higher speeds, wind speed and direction relative to vehicle motion become material in fuel usage.  Additionally, changes in vehicle configuration affecting wind resistance can be inferred by changes in fuel usage.

## Features

* Collects all weather data provided by [WeatherFlow Tempest](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/) weather station.
* ```WeatherReports``` class can be used independently to collect weather data by custom applications.
* Works with Python 3.10 and newer.
* Raspberry Pi 4 hardware and Raspberry Pi OS target environment.

## Target System

Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB RAM (or more) and with a 32 GB (or more) SD card.

## Target Hardware

The software is made to work with [WeatherFlow Tempest](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/) weather station.  The software is being tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS ```bookworm```.

## Logger Usage

```bash
$ python3.11 -m wthr_logger.wthr_logger --help
usage: wthr_logger.py [-h] [--log_file_directory LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY] [--verbose]
                      [--version]

Telemetry Weather Logger

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --log_file_directory LOG_FILE_DIRECTORY
                        Enable logging and place log files into this directory
  --verbose             Turn DEBUG logging on. Default is off.
  --version             Print version number and exit.
$
```

## ```WeatherReports``` Class Usage

```python
import logging
from wthr_logger.udp import WeatherReports

logger = logging.getLogger("weather_logger")

# Weather Report Iterable
weather_reports = WeatherReports(logger)

for raw_weather_report, weather_report in weather_reports:
    if not weather_report:
        # skipping invalid (None value) data
        continue
    print(weather_report)
```

## Log File

Logging is enabled by setting the log file directory ```--log_file_directory``` in the command line options.  The log file format is the same format used by [Telemetry OBD Logger](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-obd#telemetry-obd-logger-output-data-files).  Downstream processing of data captured by **Telemetry OBD Logger**,  **Telemetry GPS Logger**, **Telemetry IMU Logger**, **Telemetry Weather Logger** and other data sources can be processed using the same analysis tools.

### Format

Records in the log files are separated by line feeds ```<LF>```.  Each record is in JSON format representing the key/value pairs described below under [JSON Fields](#json-fields).

### JSON Fields

#### ```command_name```

The ```command_name``` identifies (```WTHR_<message type>```) the weather message type.  See **Messages** in the [WeatherFlow Tempest UDP Reference - v171](https://weatherflow.github.io/Tempest/api/udp/v171/).  The supported ```command_name```s or message types are:

* ```WTHR_evt_precip```
* ```WTHR_evt_strike```
* ```WTHR_rapid_wind```
* ```WTHR_obs_air```
* ```WTHR_obs_sky```
* ```WTHR_obs_st```
* ```WTHR_device_status```
* ```WTHR_hub_status```

#### ```obd_response_value```

Reflects the key/value pairs returned by the Weather Station.  The actual parsed Weather Station output is contained in the ```obd_response_value``` field as a dictionary (key/value pairs).  That is, ```obd_response_value``` is a field that contains subfields representing a weather record.  The subfield name is the key portion of the subfield.  The subfield value is the value part of the subfield.  Each Weather Station message type has its own unique set of subfield names for data contained in ```obd_response_value```.

See [Examples](#sample-log-data) for subfield names.

```iso_ts_pre``` ISO formatted timestamp taken before the GPS command was processed (```datetime.isoformat(datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc))```).

```iso_ts_post``` ISO formatted timestamp taken after the GPS command was processed (```datetime.isoformat(datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc))```).

### Sample Log Data

In the sample output below, the format has been modified for readability.  Below, the ```<LF>``` refers to Linux line feed and is used as a record terminator.

## Installation

Installation instructions were written for Raspberry Pi OS 64 bit:

* ```/etc/debian_version``` shows ```12.4```
* ```/etc/os-release``` shows ```VERSION="12 (bookworm)"```

With some, little or no modification, the installation instructions should work for other Linux based systems.  The amount of effort will vary by Linux distribution with Debian based distributions the easiest.

```bash
lbp@telemetry4:~ $ cat /etc/debian_version
12.4
lbp@telemetry4:~ $
```

```bash
lbp@telemetry4:~ $ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="12"
VERSION="12 (bookworm)"
VERSION_CODENAME=bookworm
ID=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"
lbp@telemetry4:~ $
```

If you are running Raspberry Pi OS version ```12.2``` (```bookworm```), you can upgrade the OS to ```12.4```.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Once the Raspberry Pi reboots, remove unused packages.

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

### Dependencies

*telemetry-wthr* requires a number of Libraries and Python packages that need to be installed before installing this package.  Follow installation instruction links for the following:

* [Python 3.11](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-obd#raspberry-pi-system-installation)
  * provides the runtime environment for the application
  * follow the above link

* [Telemetry Counter](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-counter)
  * increments and returns the system boot and application start counters for use by other telemetry applications

### Building and Installing ```wthr_logger``` Python Package

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-wthr.git
cd telemetry-wthr
python3.11 -m build .
python3.11 -m pip install dist/telemetry_wthr-0.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Weather Station Configuration

Computers wishing to receive weather data from a WeatherFlow Tempest need to be on the same LAN (local area network) as the base station.  The following network context diagram provides two network views.  The first view shows the base station sending UDP broadcast messages to all computers on the local network.  Any computers on the LAN actively listening for broadcast messages on a specific port will process these messages.  Otherwise, the messages will be discarded.

![Telemetry Weather Logging - Networking](docs/TelemetryWeatherLogging-Networking.png)

The second view shows more of a hardware view.  Weather data originates from WeatherFlow Tempest sensors and is transmitted to a WeatherFlow Tempest base station via a proprietary communications method.  Using a smart phone application, the base station is configured to use WIFI provided by the computer running this software, a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.  This Raspberry Pi provided local area network behaves like a normal WIFI/hotspot/router that may or may not be connected via Ethernet to the Internet through an optional WIFI/hotspot/router.

This method is being used for automotive weather data gathering.  Configuring a WIFI Access Point on a Raspberry Pi 4 running ```Debian 12 bookworm``` is tricky because, in this latest release of Raspberry Pi, network configuration has been dramatically changed to a new configuration subsystem called [Network Manager](https://networkmanager.dev/).   More rough spots need to be smoothed out. **Beware** - documentation regarding how to create a WIFI access point found on the Internet refers to the old way of configuring networks.

Follow the instruction found in [Configuring Raspberry Pi WIFI/Hotspot/Router](docs/wifi-hotspot-router.md).  Once you have a hotspot up and running, the weather station needs to be reconfigured/configured to work with the in-vehicle hotspot.  Follow the instructions provided by [WeatherFlow](https://tempest.earth/).

## Weather Station Vehicle Mounting

Vehicle mounting requires some thought and creativity.  Here are some [Mounting Ideas](docs/vehicle-mounting.md).

## Raspberry Pi Headless Operation

To start ```wthr_logger.wthr_logger``` at boot on a Raspberry Pi, add the section of code starting with ```# BEGIN TELEMETRY-WTHR SUPPORT``` and ending with ```# END TELEMETRY-WTHR SUPPORT``` to ```/etc/rc.local```.

```bash
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

# Print the IP address
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ "$_IP" ]; then
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
fi

# BEGIN TELEMETRY-WTHR SUPPORT
# This section goes before the TELEMETRY_OBD section

/bin/nohup "/root/bin/telemetry.rc.local.wthr" &

# END TELEMETRY-WTHR SUPPORT

# BEGIN TELEMETRY-GPS SUPPORT
# This section goes before the TELEMETRY_OBD section

/bin/nohup "/root/bin/telemetry.rc.local.gps" &

# END TELEMETRY-GPS SUPPORT

# BEGIN TELEMETRY-OBD SUPPORT

/bin/nohup "/root/bin/telemetry.rc.local" &

# END TELEMETRY-OBD SUPPORT

exit 0
```

```/etc/rc.local``` executes ```/root/bin/telemetry.rc.local.WTHR```.  In this file, the value for ```WTHR_USER``` will need to be changed to match the username responsible for running this application.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
#
# telemetry.rc.local.gps - This script is executed by the system /etc/rc.local script on system boot

export WTHR_USER="human"
export WTHR_GROUP="dialout"
export WTHR_HOME="/home/${WTHR_USER}"
export DEBUG="True"
export LOG_FILE="/tmp/telemetry-wthr_$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S').log"

# Debugging support
if [ "${DEBUG}" == "True" ]
then
	# enable shell debug mode
	set -x
fi

# turn off stdin
0<&-

# redirect all stdout and stderr to file
exec &> "${LOG_FILE}"

## Run the script gps_logger.sh as user "${GPS_USER}" and group "${GPS_GROUP}"
runuser -u "${WTHR_USER}" -g dialout "${WTHR_HOME}/telemetry-wthr/bin/gps_logger.sh" &

exit 0
```

To ready the system to autostart weather logging, copy ```telemetry.rc.local.wthr``` to ```/root/bin``` and set its file system permissions as shown below.

```bash
$ cd
$ cd telemetry-wthr/root/bin
$ sudo mkdir /root/bin
$ sudo cp telemetry.rc.local.wthr /root/bin/
$ sudo chmod 0755 /root/bin/telemetry.rc.local.wthr
$ sudo chmod 0755 /root/bin/telemetry.rc.local.wthr
$ cd
```

```/root/bin/telemetry.rc.local.wthr``` executes ```telemetry-wthr/bin/wthr_logger.sh```

Finally, set ```wthr_logger.sh``` file permissions to executable.

```bash
$ cd telemetry-wthr
$ cd bin
$ chmod 0755 wthr_logger.sh
$ cd
$
```

## Examples

See the ```bin/wthr_logger.sh``` ```bash``` shell program for an example.
